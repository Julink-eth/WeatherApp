# WeatherApp
Weather App exercice for the IDB IT consultant position

Web Application made with C# and AngularJS. 
The weather data are collected thanks to the API OpenWeatherMap : https://openweathermap.org/api

The C# part only takes care of the API, the data are then handled by AngularJS/javascript and displayed with an AngularJS template.

The application needs to be hosted on a IIS server or IIS express tp function. 

Due to the API limitation the application is not able to show the rain chance but it should meet all the other requirements.
